#There needs to be a comma between each data entry. 
#For example, there is not a comma between Marco and Carly, and 62 and 51.
#Variable names cannot have spaces

#Name <- c("Jeb", “Donald”, "Ted”, “Marco” “Carly”, “Hillary”, “Berine”)

#ABC political poll results <- c(4, 62 51, 21, 2, 14, 15)

#CBS political poll results <- c(12, 75, 43, 19, 1, 21, 19) 


#What is could be...
#I changed "Name" to "Candidate_Name" so that 
#the variable name would be more descriptive


ABC_poll<-c(4, 62, 51, 21, 2, 14, 15)
CBS_poll<-c(12, 75, 43, 19, 1, 21, 19)
Candidate_Name<-c("Jeb","Donald","Ted","Marco","Carly","Hillary","Bernie")

#rbind joins the three data sets by row to create a data.frame
dfPractice<-data.frame(rbind(Candidate_Name,ABC_poll,CBS_poll))


#cbind joins the three data sets by column name to make data.frame
dfPractice2<-data.frame(cbind(Candidate_Name,ABC_poll,CBS_poll))

#the column names can be changed if the variable names are not that descriptive
#below is what the data.frame using cbind would look like 
#adding column names
colnames(dfPractice2)<-c("Candidate Name","      ABC poll results","     CBS poll results")
print(dfPractice2)


#what data.frame looks like using rbind
print(dfPractice)

#What data.frame looks like using cbind
